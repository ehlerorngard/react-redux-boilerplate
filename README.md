# React + Redux Boilerplate

A basic boilerplate I made for my own future projects and reference;  
stunt-double API calls ready to be connected to a backend.


## Dependencies

Foundational Node modules will need to copied from those of a create-react-app, after which
```
yarn install
```
or
```
npm i
``` 
from the project's root will install the remaining necessary dependencies.
